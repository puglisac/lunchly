## Lunchly

Lunchly is an Express app that is not an API server, nor is it RESTful.

Instead, itâ€™s a server-side templated application with custom URLs.

## Setting Up

- Create a project folder, Git repository, and package.json.  
- Create a database, lunchly  
- Read in the sample data in data.sql  
- Install the required node modules:

```
$ npm install
```
Start the server with nodemon
